## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add `scripts/start-backend.sh` to run `uvicorn main:app --reload` on port 8787 from the backend directory.
- [x] 1.2 Add `scripts/stop-backend.sh` to locate the process by port 8787 and terminate it.
- [ ] 1.3 Validate manually: start script launches on port 8787; stop script terminates that process.
